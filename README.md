# Facial-Expression-Analysis
Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is an intriguing field within computer vision that aims to detect and classify human emotions based on facial expressions. Our project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve real-time facial expression recognition using the [FER 2013 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013)

Objective
Our primary objective is to develop a robust and accurate system capable of automatically detecting and classifying facial expressions into predefined emotion categories such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.

Features
Real-time Emotion Detection: Our trained model can analyze live video streams and detect facial expressions in real-time.
Multi-class Classification: The model classifies facial expressions into multiple emotion categories simultaneously.

# Why Facial Expression Recognition?
Facial expression recognition has a wide range of applications, including human-computer interaction, virtual reality, healthcare, and marketing research. By accurately identifying human emotions, our system can enhance user experiences and enable more personalized interactions in various domains.
